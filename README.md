This is not a bot, this is more of a human emulation wrapper, where we actually do the tasks persent in front of us and verify. 


if you follow through the process, its pretty taxing with verifications. You need ready access to a email for verification, a bot that knows what to do and how to do it.
A bot that can complete the verfification process. If you follow through the process it might be better to use a general action wrapper
